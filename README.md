# confessions

[Wireframes for this project](Confessions.pdf)

As a user, I want to be able to login, register, and post a confession.
As an admin, I want to be able to hold the username and password in the database, encrypt the password and have the user post their confession in a feed like style.
We have created a Twitter and Secret like app for users to post their confessions about work, school, and relationships.
From the front page we have created a login and registration toggle menu.
If the user has not created a username and password, they may do so and go straight to the confessions page.
If the user has a username and password stored in our database, they may go to the confessions page directly from the login as well.
We used HTML, CSS, LESS, Handlebars, Javascript
We had our confessions page set up so once the user is able to write their confession in the dialog box. From there, the post button will put the confession in a div below that acts as a feed.
There is a left hand menu that shows the posts of the user.
The logout button will take the user back to the login/register page.
